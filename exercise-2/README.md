# Exercise-2

In this exercise, we'll build a (very) simple multi-page application using **React Router**. There are currently two pages (Components) that are already built. For this exercise, you should **add a third page** (component) and **add a link to it**.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
