# Demo-3

This demo uses the react charting library [recharts](http://recharts.org/) to build a simple visualization of electoral college data ([source](http://state.1keydata.com/state-electoral-votes.php)) and population data ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population)). To run the demo, fork and clone this repository, then install packages and run the application:

```bash
# Install packages in the package.json file
npm install

# Start running the development server
npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
